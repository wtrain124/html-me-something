		<h2> Kansas City, MO.</h2>

		<p >
		  I was born in Smithville, Missouri, however, most of my childhood was spent in Kansas City.  
		  I attended Redemptorist from Pre-School to 3rd grade, then attended Volker Elementary for 4th and 5th grade.
		  After Volker, I attended Lincoln Prep for 6th and 7th grade.  Growing up off of 37th and Genessee,
		  I frequently rode my bike to the 39th street area, the Plaza and Clints Comics off of Main St.

		  My 8th grade year, I moved to San Diego, California.  While I'd visited California several times prior to moving there
		  I wasn't prepared for just how different things were.  I was in major culture shock in a good way.  I learned a lot of things
		  I don't think I would have learned in KC, and made lifelong friends.

		<h2> Great Lakes, IL.</h2>

		<p >
		  After high school I joined the Navy and got stationed at Great Lakes, Illinois for basic training and for Hospital Corps School.  
		  Despite growing up with snow in Kansas City, I wasn't prepared for how bitterly cold it was with the wind blowing straight off the lake
		  and the snow sometimes blocking us in the barracks to the point where we had to jump from the second story windows just to escape.
		  Sometimes a normally 10 min walk to the chow hall turned into 30.  However, because there was a nearby train I frequently visited 
		  Chicago and had some great experiences there.

		<h2> Camp Pendleton, CA.</h2>
		<img src= "http://cityinfo.medium.s3.amazonaws.com/camp-pendleton-california-1.jpg" alt= "Camp Pendleton, CA." height="250" width="600">
		<p >
		  After Hospital Corps School, I had to attend Field Medical School and EMT school.  Both of which were in Camp Pendleton, California. 
          It was great being back in California, and getting a chance to reconnect with old friends from High School while also learning a
          new myriad of skills.  That said, Camp Pendleton is a very large base with little to no public transportation and I hadn't yet
          had a chance to bring a car down since I was only a student, so I was largely dependent on rides from others.  Even though Uber 
          would have been very helpful back then, I doubt I would have been able to afford it.

		<h2> Okinawa, Japan</h2>

		  After doing a few clinical rotations around clinics in San Diego, CA. including a Branch Clinic at NTC, Point Loma (which no longer
		  exists) and Balboa Naval Hospital, I was transferred to Camp Kinser with 3rd FSSG, USMC in Okinawa, Japan.  This was one of my favorite
		  duty stations and one of the best places I've ever lived.  The weather was extremely hot and humid.  While Kansas City summers might be
		  bad, they have nothing on Okinawa.  That said, Okinawa was like a Japanese version of Hawaii.  The water was crystal clear and warm, which
		  provoked my passion for scuba diving.  I learned a lot about the Japanese culture, I got to travel to Iwo Jima, Tokyo, and Kyoto and 
		  learned a lot more about working with the Marines and gained more experience with field medicine.

		<h2> 29 Palms, CA.</h2>

		<p >
		  Because I enjoyed living in San Diego so much I wanted to get back there as soon as possible.  So, I opted not to extend my stay in Okinawa
		  and as a result ended up in the worst place I've ever lived, 29 Palms, California.  I was stationed with MWSS-374 USMC.  29 Palms is in 
		  the middle of a desert just outside of Yucca Valley and next to Joshua Tree National Park and the average temperature between spring and summer
		  can hover around 100-120 deg. Fahrenheit (even higher if you're on the flight-line).  It's about 2.5 hrs from San Diego, so I managed
		  to visit friends and surf every weekend that I wasn't on duty.  Despite being the worst place I've ever lived, the experience taught me to
		  appreciate anything outside of that hell-hole.

		<h2> Lees Summit, MO.</h2>

		<p >
		  After getting out of active duty from the Navy, I decided to move back to Kansas City to finish my bachelors.  I knew that San Diego
		  was unaffordable without my military pay and San Diego was too distracting with all the surfing and partying I was doing.  
		  Long story short, I ended up meeting my wife while I was in college and we decided to move to Lee's Summit to start a family.  We've 
		  now lived here for over 10 years with our 3 young boys.  So far Lee's Summit has been my second favorite place to live (next to San Diego).
